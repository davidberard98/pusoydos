To simplify things, we will use single letters to store user card info.  It'll hopefully be easier to parse.  It will range from A-Z, a-t.  In general, when storing cards, we will use the order C, S, H, D -- the same order used in pusoy.  A will correspond to an ace of club, while t will correspond to a king of diamonds.  This will be used since card images are numbered 1c to 13d.
